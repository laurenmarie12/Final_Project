# NYC_NDVI_LST

#My research question wants to explore if redlining, a discriminatory practice in which services were withheld from potential customers who reside in neighborhoods classified as "hazardous", had last effects on areas of NYC.
#In addition, I wanted to see if these areas were more susceptible to the changing climate and therefore investigated the relationships between these areas and NDVI + LST. 
#Therefore, I compute land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in New York City from 1984 to the 2022.



#In conclusion, HOLC grades D and C seem to have lower NDVI values than A and B on average. 
#HOLC grades D and C have greater LST values when compared to A and B on average. 
#Therefore, I conclude from this analysis that redlining has lasting effects on NYC areas, as those areas are more susceptible to intense heat based on my findings.
